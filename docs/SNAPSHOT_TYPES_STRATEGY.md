# Snapshot Types Strategy

**Date:** January 12, 2026  
**Status:** Defining Snapshot Types Based on Artist Capacity

---

## Core Principle

**Find the cross-section between what's easy, repeatable, and successful.**

Not all artists are ready for complex treatments and shot lists. We need to match snapshot types to artist capacity and experience level.

---

## The Challenge

### Two Types of Artists

**1. Experienced Content Creators**
- Comfortable with treatments and shot lists
- Can create complex, artistic snapshots
- Have videographers/editors
- Want high-production value

**2. Artists Just Starting**
- Intimidated by treatments and shot lists
- Need low-barrier of entry posts
- May be creating content solo
- Want achievable, repeatable formats

### The Goal

Help both types of artists create snapshots that are:
- ✅ **Easy** - Achievable for their skill level
- ✅ **Repeatable** - Can be done consistently
- ✅ **Successful** - Actually perform well on social media

---

## Current Social Media Trends

### Instagram is Pushing "Raw" Content
- Authentic, unpolished content performs better
- Behind-the-scenes, candid moments
- Less production value, more realness
- Feels artistic and not AI-made

### What Works
- Content that feels human, not manufactured
- Artistic but achievable
- Story-telling through visuals
- Consistent aesthetic without being formulaic

---

## Snapshot Type Categories

### Category 1: Low-Barrier Entry (For Beginners)

**Characteristics:**
- Can be created solo
- Minimal equipment needed
- Quick to produce (30 min - 2 hours)
- No complex planning required

**Examples:**

- **Lyric videos** - Simple text over music
- **Quick performance clips** - Guitar, piano, vocals (one take)
- **Day-in-the-life** - Candid moments, getting ready
- **Visual mood boards** - Static images with music overlay

- Solo creator
- Building consistency first, quality later

---

### Category 2: Medium Complexity (For Intermediate)

**Characteristics:**
- May need basic planning

---

### Category 3: High Production (For Advanced)

**Characteristics:**
- Requires treatment and shot list
- Team collaboration (videographer, editor)
- 4+ hours to produce
- Complex planning and execution

**Examples:**

**When to Use:**
- Artist has content creation experience

## Determining Snapshot Types in Onboarding

### Questions to Ask

**1. Content Creation Experience**
- "How comfortable are you creating video content?"
  - Never done it / Just starting
  - Some experience / Learning
  - Comfortable / Experienced
  - Professional / Have team

**2. Time & Resources**
- "How much time can you dedicate to creating snapshots?"
  - 1-2 hours per week (Low-barrier)
  - 3-5 hours per week (Medium)
  - 6+ hours per week (High production)

**3. Equipment & Team**
- "What equipment do you have?"
  - Just phone
  - Phone + basic equipment
  - Camera + equipment
  - Full setup + team

**4. Comfort with Planning**
- "How comfortable are you with planning content?"
  - Prefer quick, spontaneous
  - Some planning is okay
  - Comfortable with detailed planning
  - Love detailed treatments and shot lists

**5. Content Style Preference**
- "What type of content do you want to create?"
  - Quick, authentic, raw
  - Some planning, polished
  - High-production, cinematic
  - Mix of all types

## The "Easy, Repeatable, Successful" Cross-Section

### Easy
- **Low-barrier:** Phone camera, no planning, 30 min
- **Medium:** Basic planning, 2-4 hours
- **High:** Full treatment, team, 4+ hours

### Repeatable
- **Low-barrier:** Can do weekly, same format
- **Medium:** Can do 2-3x per week, mix formats
- **High:** Can do 1-2x per week, consistent quality

### Successful
- **Low-barrier:** Authentic, "raw" content performs well
- **Medium:** Artistic but achievable, good engagement
- **High:** High-production, strong visual identity, drives streams

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Onboarding Questionnaire Updates

Add questions to determine:
1. Content creation experience level
2. Time availability
3. Equipment/resources
4. Comfort with planning
5. Content style preference

### Snapshot Type Assignment

Based on answers, assign snapshot types:
- **Beginner** → Low-barrier entry types
- **Intermediate** → Medium complexity types
- **Advanced** → High production types

### Gradual Progression

Allow artists to:
- Start with low-barrier types
- Progress to medium complexity as they gain experience
- Eventually create high-production content

---

## Questions to Answer

1. **How do we determine artist level?**
   - Onboarding questions?
   - Self-assessment?
   - Combination?

2. **Should we allow mixing types?**
   - Can beginner do some medium complexity?
   - Can advanced do some low-barrier for consistency?

3. **How do we help artists progress?**
   - Suggest leveling up when ready?
   - Provide templates/guides for next level?

4. **What about "raw" content?**
   - How do we encourage authentic, unpolished content?
   - How do we balance "raw" with artistic?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Update Onboarding Questionnaire** - Add content creation experience questions
2. **Create Snapshot Type System** - Categorize by difficulty/barrier
3. **Build Recommendation Engine** - Suggest types based on artist profile
4. **Create Templates/Guides** - Help artists create each type
5. **Track Performance** - See which types perform best for each artist level

**Remember: Find the cross-section between easy, repeatable, and successful. Match snapshot types to artist capacity.**
