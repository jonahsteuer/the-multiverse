# Content Enjoyment Strategy

**Date:** January 12, 2026  
**Status:** Core Principle Update

---

## Core Principle

**Consistency is impossible if artists don't enjoy making the content.**

The #1 reason artists fail to post consistently is because they don't enjoy the content creation process. We need to help them find content formats they actually enjoy making, not just formats that perform well.

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Content Enjoyment = Consistency

**The Problem:**
- Artists try to create content they think will perform well
- But if they don't enjoy making it, they won't stay consistent
- Consistency is more important than individual post performance

**The Solution:**
- Ask artists what content they ENJOY making
- Help them find their MVP (Most Valuable Post format)
- Build their schedule around formats they actually want to create

---

### 2. MVP (Most Valuable Post) Strategy

**What is an MVP?**
The content format that is:
- ✅ **Enjoyable** - Artist actually likes making it
- ✅ **Repeatable** - Simple enough to do consistently
- ✅ **Efficient** - Doesn't take too much time or editing
- ✅ **Successful** - Performs well (or has potential)

**How to Find MVP:**
1. Ask about content they enjoy making
2. Analyze their best-performing posts
3. Identify the intersection: What do they enjoy AND what performs well?
4. That's their MVP format

**Examples of MVP Formats:**
- "I love vlog-style talking to camera" → MVP = Talking head videos
- "I enjoy quick guitar performances" → MVP = Simple performance clips
- "I like behind-the-scenes moments" → MVP = Candid BTS content

### 3. Algorithm-Guided Snapshot Creation

**The Challenge:**
- Artists want creative freedom
- But we know what works for growth
- Need to balance both

**The Solution:**
- Create snapshot ideas within our algorithm's recommendations
- Artist approves the ideas
- Then work backwards: edits → shoot days → treatment
- When they create NEW snapshots, guide them within algorithm bounds
- But always prioritize formats they enjoy

**Workflow:**
1. **Platform generates snapshot ideas** (based on algorithm + artist profile)
2. **Artist reviews and approves** (can edit, add, or remove)
3. **Platform works backwards:**
   - Approved snapshots → Edit deadlines → Shoot days → Treatments
4. **Artist can add more snapshots** (but guided by algorithm)
5. **All snapshots stay within algorithm recommendations**

---

### 4. Editable Content Schedule

**The Approach:**
- Platform creates an **outline schedule** (not final)
- Artist can:
  - Edit individual snapshots
  - Add more snapshots
  - Remove snapshots
  - Adjust dates
- But all edits stay within algorithm recommendations

**Why Editable?**
- Artists need control and flexibility
- But we guide them toward what works
- Balance: Our recommendations + Their preferences

---

### 5. Brand Building vs. Viral Goals

**The Distinction:**
- **Viral Goals:** One post that gets millions of views
- **Brand Building Goals:** Consistent content that builds a loyal fanbase over time

**Our Focus:**
- Help artists understand the difference
- Guide them toward brand building (consistency over virality)
- But also help them create content that has viral potential

**How We Help:**
- Explain the difference in onboarding
- Set goals based on their preference
- Track metrics that matter for brand building (not just views)
- Show them how consistency builds fanbase over time

---

## Implementation in Onboarding

### New Questions to Add:

**Q: What kind of content do you enjoy making?**
- Options:
  - Vlog-style talking to camera
  - Performance videos (guitar, piano, vocals)
  - Behind-the-scenes content
  - Lyric videos
  - Dance/choreography
  - Day-in-the-life
  - Other (describe)

**Q: What's your content creation goal?**
- Options:
  - Brand building (consistent content, loyal fanbase)
  - Viral content (one big hit)
  - Mix of both
  - Not sure yet

**Q: What's your MVP format? (If you know it)**
- "Do you have a content format that you enjoy making AND that performs well?"
- If yes: Describe it
- If no: We'll help you find it

---

## Algorithm-Guided Snapshot Creation

### When Creating New Snapshots:

**Platform suggests:**
- Formats based on:
  - What artist enjoys (from onboarding)
  - What performs well (from their best posts)
  - What's achievable (based on their experience level)
  - What builds brand (not just viral)

**Artist can:**
- Approve suggestions
- Edit suggestions
- Add their own ideas (but we guide them)
- Remove suggestions

**All snapshots must:**
- Be within algorithm recommendations
- Match artist's enjoyment preferences
- Be achievable for their skill level
- Support brand building goals

---

## MVP Finding Process

### Step 1: Identify What They Enjoy
- Ask in onboarding: "What content do you enjoy making?"
- Analyze their best posts: "What format were these?"
- Find the intersection

### Step 2: Test and Validate
- Create snapshots in their preferred format
- Track performance
- See if it's repeatable

### Step 3: Refine MVP
- If it works: Make it their primary format
- If it doesn't: Adjust and find new MVP
- Always prioritize enjoyment + repeatability

---

## Content Approachability

### For Newer Artists:

**Focus on:**
- Low-barrier formats (phone camera, minimal editing)
- Quick to create (30 min - 2 hours)
- Formats they enjoy (not complex productions)

**Avoid:**
- Intimidating formats (complex treatments, shot lists)
- Time-consuming formats (unless they love it)
- Formats that require teams (unless they have one)

**Progression:**
- Start with simple, enjoyable formats
- Build consistency first
- Gradually level up as they gain experience

## Brand Building vs. Viral Strategy

### Brand Building (Recommended):
- **Focus:** Consistent posting, loyal fanbase
- **Metrics:** Engagement rate, repeat viewers, fan growth
- **Content:** Cohesive visual identity, storytelling
- **Goal:** Long-term fanbase growth

### Viral Strategy:
- **Focus:** One big hit
- **Metrics:** Views, shares, reach
- **Content:** Trend-based, attention-grabbing
- **Goal:** Maximum exposure

### Our Approach:
- Help artists understand both
- Guide toward brand building (more sustainable)
- But create content with viral potential
- Balance: Brand consistency + Viral moments

---

## Updated Workflow

### 1. Onboarding
- Ask: What content do you enjoy making?
- Ask: What's your goal? (Brand building vs. viral)
- Identify: Their MVP format (if they know it)

### 2. Snapshot Schedule Creation
- Platform generates outline schedule
- Based on: Enjoyment + Algorithm + Goals
- Artist can edit, add, or remove

### 3. Snapshot Approval
- Platform suggests snapshot ideas
- Artist reviews and approves
- Can edit or add their own (guided by algorithm)

### 4. Backwards Planning
- Approved snapshots → Edit deadlines
- Edit deadlines → Shoot days
- Shoot days → Treatments

### 5. Ongoing Creation
- When artist adds new snapshots
- Platform guides within algorithm
- But prioritizes formats they enjoy

## Questions to Answer

1. **How do we identify MVP?**
   - Onboarding questions?
   - Performance analysis?
   - Both?

2. **How strict should algorithm guidance be?**
   - Strict (must follow recommendations)?
   - Flexible (suggestions only)?
   - Adaptive (learns from artist preferences)?

3. **How do we balance enjoyment vs. performance?**
   - Prioritize enjoyment (consistency)?
   - Prioritize performance (growth)?
   - Find intersection?

4. **How do we help with brand building vs. viral?**
   - Explain in onboarding?
   - Set goals?
   - Track different metrics?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Update Onboarding Form** - Add content enjoyment questions
2. **Update Spec** - Incorporate these principles
3. **Build MVP Finder** - Algorithm to identify MVP format
4. **Build Approval Workflow** - Snapshot ideas → Approval → Backwards planning
5. **Build Editable Schedule** - Outline schedule that can be edited

---

**Remember: Consistency is impossible if artists don't enjoy making the content. Help them find their MVP and build from there.**
